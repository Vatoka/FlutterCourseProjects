# The App Brewery Flutter Course Projects
The purpose of this repository is to save and share all the projects I created while learning flutter using a [wonderful course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WB63@7BlmzVsKMT_RNfFF4HBD7RmH7W4-_yNVl946VrOeIM_gzCjWBbVlIlN6gZcSDAgf/) I found on Udemy. If you would like to learn Flutter I recommend you check out the course! 

## My Routine
I tried to complete one section every day... some days I was able to do 2 sections but for the longer sections which took around 4 hours to complete I had to split them into 2 days.

# Project Catalog
A catalog of information and images of all of the projects.
All of these projects are compatible with all flutter-supported devices. Testing was only done on the web because I don't have a mac to run IOS on & I don't like Android. 


## I Am Rich

This is a buisness card app... I added a config file to make it easier to change the information.

A dice app if you ever lose the dice for monopoly. Introduction to States and functional things with dart & flutter.


## Magic 8 Ball
![Completed Magic 8 Ball App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25858828/163725787-440bb5c8-3ebf-4cd9-9ffa-ca3f5f0c8b94.gif)

I was able to create this App on my own after creating Dicee. This app changes state every time it's clicked, a new number between 1-5 is generated and then the corresponding image is displayed.
